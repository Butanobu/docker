Headline: Upstart preventing apt-get install

Symptom: Sometimes, you just can't apt-get install something - it fails with messages about upstart not running.

Problem: Upstart isn't running inside the container so any (broken!) installer that checks for upstart to be running will fail.

Solution: Trick the installer into thinking Upstart is running by temporarily removing upstart and replacing it with true.

Snippet:
  dpkg-divert --local --rename --add /sbin/initctl && \
  ln -s /bin/true /sbin/initctl && \
  <insert troublesome code here> && \
  rm /sbin/initctl && \
  dpkg-divert --rename --remove /sbin/initctl && \

Tip: This assumes you haven't issued a USER directive in the Dockerfile.

Attribution: So many people use this same snippet that I don't know who to credit for it...

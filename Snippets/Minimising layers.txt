Headline: Minimising number of layers

Symptom: Lots of layers...

Problem: Lots of Dockerfile commands...

Solution: Some basic commandline-fu. Double-ampersand allows command chaining on a single command line in Bash. A backslash at the end of the line in a Dockerfile continues the same command line on a separate line of the text file. Make it pretty, make it neat, make it less layered.

Snippet:

Ugly version

  RUN command_a arg1 arg2 arg3
  RUN command_b arg4 arg5 arg6
  RUN command_c arg7 arg8 arg9

One-line version

  RUN command_a arg1 arg2 arg3 && command_b arg4 arg5 arg6 && command_c arg7 arg8 arg9

Pretty, multi-line version

  RUN \
      command_a arg1 arg2 arg3 && \
      command_b arg4 arg5 arg6 && \
      command_c arg7 arg8 arg9

Tip: You can't avoid some layering, and the limitation people have reported with AUFS layers has moved into the future, but minimising where possible will make your layers a bit more human-readable (think: "docker history").

Attribution:
Err. Probably the people who wrote Linux, Bash and Docker...or something...I dunno.
